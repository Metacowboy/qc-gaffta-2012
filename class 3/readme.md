## [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/)

* Like OSC, but for sharing images between applications.
* Downloads
    * [Syphon Quartz Composer Plug-In](http://syphon-implementations.googlecode.com/files/Syphon%20For%20Quartz%20Composer%20Public%20Beta%202.dmg)
    * [Syphon Simple Server/Client](http://syphon-implementations.googlecode.com/files/Syphon%20Demo%20Apps%20Public%20Beta%202.dmg) for testing
    * [Syphon Recorder](http://bit.ly/h1cLS5) records Syphon image streams to disk
* When `Syphon Server` is set to Source as OpenGL Scene, it will grab *any layers below it* in the Viewer.

## `Accumulator`

![Accumulator Pattern](https://github.com/electronicwhisper/qc-gaffta-2012/raw/master/class%203/accumulator%20pattern.png)

* Feedback effects
* Drawing

## `JavaScript`

* Think of it as a more advanced `Mathematical Expression`.
* The `main` function has extra stuff to annotate the *types* of the inputs and outputs (i.e. **Number**, **String**, **Structure**, etc.). Other than that, we're using straight JavaScript (without the DOM of course).
* The `main` function is called any time any input changes.
* Variables outside the `main` function maintain state. See the state example.
* QC **Structure**s translate to JavaScript Arrays and Objects.
