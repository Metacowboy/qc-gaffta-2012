# Class 2

We'll be looking at combining Quartz Composer with other applications and hardware. Specifically we'll look at:

* OSC
* Kinect
* Syphon

On the technical side, we'll review and then dig deeper into macro patches.

## OSC

[FaceOSC](https://github.com/downloads/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/FaceOSC.zip), 8338

## Plug-Ins

Quartz Composer supports custom-made patches and there's a community of independent developers adding exciting functionality to QC.

To install plug-ins that you download, you'll want to put the .plugin file into:

`/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins`

If this folder doesn't exist, create it.

Note however that plug-ins from [Kineme](http://kineme.net/) want to live in:

`/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Patches`

I have made a [list on the wiki](https://github.com/electronicwhisper/qc-gaffta-2012/wiki/Quartz-Composer-Plug-Ins) with all of the QC Plug-Ins that I know of.
